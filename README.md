# 3D-Projectile-Motion-Simulation-with-Work-and-Kinetic-Energy-Analysis
This project simulates the motion of two projectiles in a 3D environment using VPython 3.2. The simulation calculates and visualizes the kinetic energy and work done on each object over time. This program demonstrates fundamental physics concepts such as projectile motion, momentum, and energy transformations.
